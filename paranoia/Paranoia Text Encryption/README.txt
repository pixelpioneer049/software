FAQ
===

Issue: The message is decrypted even when I change the algorithm in the app settings. How is that possible?
Answer: You can set an ENCRYPTION algorithm (the decryption algorithm is detected automatically - the information about the used algorithm is part of the app data format).


Issue: The application produces a completely different output (using the same input) whenever I tap the decrypt button. How is that possible?
Answer: Two words for Google: cryptographic salt
